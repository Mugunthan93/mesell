## Status vocabulary

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `PENDING` | Feature is on the lead's backlog; no branch exists yet. |
| `IN PROGRESS` | A `feature/{name}/infra` branch exists; lead is actively committing. |
| `IN REVIEW` | A PR is open against `feature/{name}`; awaiting lead self-review approval. |
| `MERGED` | The infra group's PR has merged to `feature/{name}` — the group is done for this feature. |
| `BLOCKED` | Work stopped pending an inter-lead request, infra change, or founder decision. |

A feature row stays on the Active features table until the infra group's PR merges to `feature/{name}`; then it moves to "Recently merged" for 14 days before being removed.

## Acceptance gate

Group-PR approval criteria live in the infra PR template at `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/infra.md`. The lead approves a `feature/{name}/infra` → `feature/{name}` PR only when the template is filled completely — including the `terraform plan` output (`Plan: X to add, Y to change, Z to destroy`), `kubectl apply --dry-run=server` clean output, secret refs documented with no JSON keys, Workload Identity Federation paths confirmed, smoke deploy to `dev` succeeded (`kubectl get pods -n dev` Ready), cost impact estimate recorded (with explicit founder sign-off for any change > ₹500/month) — plus CI gate-3 (lint — manifest validation) green and the rollback procedure for the resource type documented per `docs/INFRASTRUCTURE_PLAYBOOK.md`.
