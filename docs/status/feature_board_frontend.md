## Active features

| Feature | Group branch | Status | Current session | Last touched | Blocking | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| smart-picker | feature/smart-picker/frontend | IN PROGRESS | mesell-smart-picker-frontend-session-1 (SPEC-only) | 2026-06-11 | none | V1 Feature 2 — LAST slice (AI #54 + backend #72 MERGED on feature/smart-picker/integration @ ba94543; founder gate PR #55 OPEN). HYBRID step 1: lead authored 2 specialist specs (component-builder + service-builder); branch cut from integration ba94543. D4 rename catalog-new->smart-picker (first commit, component-builder). Route /catalogs/new UNCHANGED. RECONCILIATIONS (lead-ruled, see specs): (1) backend §9.E CategorySuggestion has NO commission_pct -- card OMITS commission for V1 (was a simulated-data invention); (2) NO HttpClient/interceptor/ApiClient exist yet on integration -- service-builder INTRODUCES provideHttpClient at this slice (feature-scoped); confidence is 0-1 float not 0-100. Conflict vs SP03 onboarding: DISJOINT (already merged; routes present on integration; line-disjoint in app.routes.ts). Specialists dispatched by master (step 2); lead gates at step 3. |

## Inter-lead requests open

| To lead | About feature | Request | Opened | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| meesell-infra-builder | mfe-pricing | D13 Option-C hosting: GCS bucket + Cloud CDN + remotes.mesell.xyz DNS/cert + cloudbuild.remote.yaml upload pipeline + per-env manifest URL templating. Locally dev-validated (localhost remote); prod surface pending. See handoff_mf_pricing_deploy.md | 2026-06-11 | OPEN |
| meesell-infra-builder | mfe-export | D19 second-remote prefix gs://meesell-frontend/{env}/mfe-export/{version}/ + confirm dorny/paths-filter matrix fans out apps/mfe-export/** as its own build unit (C-CI-1). RECORD-ONLY — D13 hosting deferred to SP04-05 per founder ruling; extends the open SP01 request, NOT a new active ask. See handoff_mf_export_deploy.md | 2026-06-11 | OPEN |
| meesell-infra-builder | mfe-onboarding | D24 third-remote prefix gs://meesell-frontend/{env}/mfe-onboarding/{version}/ (port 4202) + matrix unit apps/mfe-onboarding/** (C-CI-1). FIRST remote sharing @mesell/core (_mesell_core chunk) — CDN must serve the SAME core module URL to shell + all auth-consuming remotes (no per-remote stale dup, or singleton drift returns). RECORD-ONLY — D13 hosting deferred to SP04-05 per founder ruling. See handoff_mf_onboarding_deploy.md | 2026-06-11 | OPEN |
| meesell-infra-builder | mf-workspace-foundation | CI matrix rewrite (C-CI-1) ready before Sub-Plan 1; confirm new frontend/libs/** paths resolve against build-frontend glob. See handoff_mf_ci_prep.md. NOTE: chore/ci-matrix-c-ci-1 worktree observed in flight 2026-06-11 — SP01 now adds apps/mfe-pricing/** as the first per-remote build unit (cloudbuild.remote.yaml). | 2026-06-10 | OPEN |

## Status vocabulary

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `PENDING` | Feature is on the lead's backlog; no branch exists yet. |
| `IN PROGRESS` | A `feature/{name}/frontend` branch exists; specialist is actively committing. |
| `IN REVIEW` | A PR is open against `feature/{name}`; awaiting lead approval. |
| `MERGED` | The frontend group's PR has merged to `feature/{name}` — the group is done for this feature. |
| `BLOCKED` | Work stopped pending an inter-lead request, infra change, or founder decision. |

A feature row stays on the active features table until the frontend group's PR merges to `feature/{name}`; then it moves to "Recently merged" for 14 days before being removed.

## Acceptance gate

Every `feature/{name}/frontend` → `feature/{name}` PR is reviewed against the checklist in `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/frontend.md`. The lead does not merge until every box is checked: build < 90 s (CLAUDE.md Decision 12), bundle delta noted, screenshots at 360 px and 1280 px attached, accessibility checks confirmed, CI gates 1 + 3 green. See repo management master plan §2.1 + the Merge gate section of `.claude/agents/meesell-frontend-coordinator.md`.
