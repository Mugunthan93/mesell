## CI/CD Dev Pipeline — Phase E + F — 2026-06-10
New resources (all in `modules/ci_identity/main.tf`, GitLab resources untouched):
- `google_service_account.meesell_github_ci` (account_id from var, description must be ≤256 chars — keep it tight)
- `google_iam_workload_identity_pool.github_actions` (`github-actions-pool`)
- `google_iam_workload_identity_pool_provider.github_actions` (`github-actions-provider`, issuer `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`, condition `assertion.repository == var.github_repository`)
- `google_service_account_iam_member.github_wif_impersonation`
- 4× `google_project_iam_member`: artifactregistry.writer, cloudbuild.builds.editor, secretmanager.secretAccessor, iap.tunnelResourceAccessor
- 1× `google_compute_instance_iam_member.github_ci_vm_instance_admin` — VM-scoped `compute.instanceAdmin.v1` (the brief's "scoped to meesell-dev VM" constraint enforced)

**Why VM-scoped instanceAdmin and not project-level:** Phase E discipline. Project-level `compute.instanceAdmin.v1` would let the github-ci SA administer EVERY VM in the project (including shotfox-platform etc. owned by other teams). Resource-level binding via `google_compute_instance_iam_member` enforces "this SA can administer ONLY `meesell-dev`."

**Brief reconciliation — things that were stale by the time I read the brief:**

1. **backend.tf "LOCAL — do not change"**: GCS migration ran ~3 hours before this session. Respected "do not change" — backend.tf stays GCS-backed. DEVOPS doc §4.5 reflects the live reality.

2. **"ALSO codify D-API-5 Cloud Build SA perms" in `ci_identity`**: already codified in `module.cloudbuild_permissions` by the prior session. Cross-referenced in DEVOPS §1.2 + §6.2; NOT duplicated in `ci_identity`. If I had duplicated, terraform would have hit a "binding already in state" error.

3. **"frontend/ does not exist yet — make conditional"**: `frontend/` (Angular sources) DOES exist now (Wave 2B in progress), but `frontend/Dockerfile` does NOT exist yet. Conditional gates on the Dockerfile, not the directory.

4. **"cloudbuild.yaml does not exist — create it"**: It already exists. Updated in place (added worker, made frontend conditional).

**`gcp_api_services` extended:** added `cloudbuild.googleapis.com` (already enabled out-of-band during Phase D — adopting into TF state) and `iap.googleapis.com` (needed for IAP tunneling on first deploy). The plan shows them as "+ 2 to create" — idempotent adoption for cloudbuild, real enable for iap.

**terraform plan output:** **11 to add, 1 to change, 0 to destroy**. Saved at `.tflogs/phase-e-plan-output.txt` (245 lines).

The "1 to change" is `module.billing_budget.google_billing_budget.meesell_dev_budget` — benign: `budget_filter.projects` recomputes from hardcoded `["projects/888244156264"]` to `(known after apply)`. Pre-existing drift from `data.google_project.current`; NOT my change. Will keep recurring on every plan until someone refactors how the budget filter is rendered.

**WIF attribute condition decision (WIF-1):** went with repository-only (`assertion.repository == "Mugunthan93/mesell"`), NOT repo+ref. Rationale documented in DEVOPS §4.3: CI must run on PRs to gate them, and PRs run from feature branches. Tightening to `main` only would force a separate WIF binding for PR runs. Recommend tightening to repo+ref after V1 GA when manual `workflow_dispatch` from feature branches isn't expected.

**Things explicitly NOT done (per brief constraints):**
- No `terraform apply` — founder runs from laptop after reviewing plan
- No modification of GitLab pool/SA/bindings — they're locked
- No K8s manifest changes
- No push to main — work stays on the feature branch
- No `BACKEND_ARCHITECTURE.md` edits

**Founder action checklist after this session** (in order):
1. Review `.tflogs/phase-e-plan-output.txt`
2. `cd infra/terraform && terraform apply -var-file=environments/dev.tfvars -var "postgres_password=$(cat ~/.meesell-secrets/dev-postgres-password)" -var "valkey_password=$(cat ~/.meesell-secrets/dev-valkey-password)"`
3. `terraform output github_wif_provider_name && terraform output github_ci_sa_email`
4. GitHub repo Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables: set `GCP_WIF_PROVIDER` and `GCP_CI_SA_EMAIL` from step 3
5. Generate low-quota Gemini key; set as repo Secret `GEMINI_API_KEY_CI`
6. Branch protection on `main` to require the 5 CI checks
7. Merge feature branch → main; first push fires the full pipeline.
